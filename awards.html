      <p class="whitep">2021 was a crazy year, spending more of it in isolation keeping safe from Covid-19. With many places being closed for entertainment, like malls and movie theaters just opening recently, we have had lots of time at home trying to entertian ourselves. Watching new movies, listening to new songs and playing new games were all part of isolation and entertainment at home. Below I will mention all notable awards given to creators, producers and artists.</p>
